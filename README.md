Codes used for cosmic ray analysis in "Fat Cosmic Ray Tracks in CCDS". Images are not included in this repository; they can be found on e.g. NCSA.


<b>CRAnalysis.ipynb</b>: Code for measuring cosmic ray tracks. Takes a directory of .fits files each containing one cosmic ray, measures each one's properties, and eventually saves each width, dE/dx, and height for plotting.

<b>CRFluxes.ipynb</b>: Estimates the vertical flux of different cosmic rays at varying altitudes, using equations from Gaisser (1990).

<b>deltaRanges.ipynb</b>: Calculates the expected number of delta-rays generated by cosmic rays in Si using equations from Grupen & Schwartz (2008) and Zyla et al. (2020).

<b>findCosmics.ipynb</b>: Extracts cosmic rays from images using the LSST Science Pipelines. As written, requires an environment set up with the pipelines as well as image data collections. Cosmic rays are saved to individual .fits files. Written by Merlin Fisher-Levine, adapted by Theodore Grosson.

<b>plot_dedx-depth-width.ipynb</b>: Takes the width, dE/dx, and height of observed and simulated tracks segments and plots them.
